This is a dictionary of English programming terms for Microsoft Word. Add it to Word's proofing options and it'll get rid of red squiggly lines on futuristic and zombtastic words like "mutator."

I haven't added many terms. Please send a pull request to add your favorites.

How do I use it?
---

*Word 2013 (En)* File, Options, Proofing, Custom Dictionaries, and browse to red-squiggly-braces.dic.

I'm still researching if there's an ideal place to locate red-squiggly-braces.dic such that it roams between PCs.

*Word Web App* Unfortunately Word custom dictionaries can't roam to the web app. When it becomes possible I'll update this.

*Word for Mac* I'll look into it when a modern version releases.

How can I add to it?

Word's .dic files are just crlf-delimited files. Add words to the file using any text editor. The Custom Dictionaries screen also allows you to add words. Finally (I don't recommend this) if in Custom Dictionaries you set the file as the default, when you use the "Add to Dictionary" option in Word it'll append to the file.
